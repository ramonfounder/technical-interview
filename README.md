# Java Interview Challenges

This repository contains solutions to three common technical interview challenges, implemented in Java. The challenges are:

1. **Candy Problem**: This problem involves determining which children can have the greatest number of candies after being given a certain number of extra candies.

2. **Maximum Number of Vowels**: This problem is currently a placeholder and will be updated with a solution soon.

3. **Maze Solver**: This problem involves finding the shortest path from a source to a destination in a binary maze.

## Getting Started

To run these solutions, you will need a Java development environment. You can use any IDE that supports Java, but the code has been developed and tested in IntelliJ IDEA 2023.3.6.

## Running the Solutions

Each problem is solved in its own Java class:

- `CandyProblem.java`
- `MaximumNumberVowels.java`
- `MazeSolver.java`

You can run each solution by executing the `main` method in the corresponding class.
